# eCommerce

This repo contains a the solution to an ecommerce website project, it is an ASP Web Application and a WCF Service, that were created using a visual studio commmunity 2019. 
For the website a template was used as the objective of the project was to test if I could extensively manipulate a web template consisting of html, css, and javascript, into
a responsive website that could perform dynamic population using data that is stored in database.

The solution has two projects
#Web - consists of the front end, it is a responsive website
#Svc - consists of the service functions and database
For it to work, the svc should be run before the web
